   <h1>DroneBridge for ESP32</h1>
</div>

A DroneBridge enabled firmware for the popular ESP32 modules from Espressif Systems. Probably the cheapest way to
communicate with your drone, UAV, UAS, ground based vehicle or whatever you may call them.

It also allows for a fully transparent serial to WiFi pass through link with variable packet size
(Continuous stream of data required).

DroneBridge for ESP32 is a telemetry/low data rate only solution. There is no support for cameras connected to the ESP32 
since it does not support video encoding.

## Download or Compile

Ready to use binaries for ESP32 via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/releases).  
Or compile using esp-idf v5.1:
-   ESP32   `idf.py set-target esp32 build`
-   ESP32S2 `idf.py set-target esp32s2 build`
-   ESP32S3 `idf.py set-target esp32s3 build`
-   ESP32C3 `idf.py set-target esp32c3 build`

## Installation/Flashing using precompiled binaries

First download the latest release from this repository.
[You can find them here](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/releases).

There are many multiple ways on how to flash the firmware.  
**[For further info please check the wiki!](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/wiki/Flashing-DroneBridge-for-ESP32)**

## Wiring

1.  Connect the UART of the ESP32 to a 3.3V UART of your flight controller. It is not recommended to use the ESP32s pins that are marked with TX & RX since they often are connected to the internal serial ouput. Go for any other pin instead!
2.  Set the flight controller port to the desired protocol.

**Check out manufacturer datasheet! Only some modules can take more than 3.3V. Follow the recommendations by the ESP32 boards manufacturer for powering the device**  
**[For further info please check the wiki!](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/wiki/Wiring-Instructions)**

## Configuration
1.  Connect to the wifi `DroneBridge ESP32` with password `dronebridge`
2.  In your browser type: `dronebridge.local` (Chrome: `http://dronebridge.local`) or `192.168.2.1` into the address bar.
 **You might need to disable the cellular connection to force the browser to use the WiFi connection**
3.  Configure as you please and hit `save`

![DroneBridge for ESP32 web interface](wiki/dbesp32_webinterface.png)

**[For further info please check the wiki!](https://github.com/DroneBridge/ESP32/wiki/Configuration)**

## Use with QGroundControl, Mission Planner or any other GCS

![QGroundControl](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/assets/connected_vehicle.C1qygcZV.jpg)

-   The ESP will auto send data to all connected devices via UDP to port 14550. QGroundControl should auto connect using UDP
-   Connect via **TCP on port 5760** or **UDP on port 14550** to the ESP32 to send & receive data with a GCS of your choice. 
-   **In case of a UDP connection the GCS must send at least one packet (e.g. MAVLink heart beat etc.) to the UDP port of the ESP32 to register as an end point.**
-   Manually add a UDP target usign the webinterface

## Developers

### Compile
 You will need the Espressif SDK: esp-idf + toolchain. Check out their website for more info and on how to set it up.
 The code is written in pure C using the esp-idf (no arduino libs).

 **This project supports the v5.1.2 of ESP-IDF**  
 Compile and flash by running: `idf.py build`, `idf.py flash`

The webinterface builds using the command `idf.py frontend`. This is done automatically when compiling the entire project using `idf.py build`. 
The frontend is build to `build/frontend`.  
Alternatively, the frontend can be built using `npm install && npm i -D shx && npm run build` within `/frontend/`, then manually copy the content of `/frontend/build` to `/build/frontend`

 ### API
The webinterface communicates with a REST:API on the ESP32. You can use that API to set configurations not selectable 
via the web-interface (e.g. baud rate). It also allows you to easily integrate DroneBridge for ESP32.


#### Request settings
```http request
GET http://dronebridge.local/api/settings
```

#### Request stats

```

#### Assign a static IP to the ESP32 when in WiFi client mode:
Send a valid JSON to set static IP, send the same JSON but with empty strings (`"client_ip": ""`) to remove static IP setting
```json
 {
  "client_ip": "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX",
  "netmask": "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX",
  "gw_ip": "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX"
 }
```
to
```http request
POST http://dronebridge.local/api/settings/static-ip
```

 ### Testing
Check `/test` for scripts triggering the API.

 To test the frontend without the ESP32 run 

 ```sh
 npm install -g json-server
 json-server db.json --routes routes.json
 ```
Set `const ROOT_URL = "http://localhost:3000/"` inside `index.html` and the `<script>` block
